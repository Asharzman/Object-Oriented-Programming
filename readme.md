# Object Oriented Programming - TTC8440

## Description

This is the course I took at JAMK, where C# was used.
In this repository is every task of the course, and I successfully completed all of them.
Note: Some tasks are only as .cs files but T31-T43 comes with the project file for Visual Studio Community 2022.
